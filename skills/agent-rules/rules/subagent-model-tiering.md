# subagent-model-tiering.md

Applies: every project.

Match the sub-agent's model to the task; never default every spawn to
the session model. Think in three cost tiers, cheapest to most
expensive, named by **role** so the rule survives new model releases — a
**cheap tier** (Sonnet today), a **mid tier** (Opus today), and a single
**heavy-hitter tier**: the most expensive model the session offers
(Fable at the time of writing, but read it as whatever the top tier is
when you run). Reserve each tier for where its extra capability pays
off.

## The tiers

- **Cheap tier for mechanical, well-specified work** — one right answer,
  a clear spec: lint remediation (`id-length`, `no-magic-numbers`, other
  cap fixes with an obvious extraction), mechanical renames,
  straightforward test scaffolding, doc/format passes,
  search-and-collate.
- **Mid tier for judgment-heavy work:** structural refactors of long or
  complex files (splitting modules along seams, decomposing
  high-complexity functions without changing behavior), architecture and
  interface design, ambiguous or underspecified tasks,
  security-sensitive or money-moving code, and cross-cutting changes
  whose blast radius needs weighing.
- **The heavy hitter is opt-in, never a silent default.** Before
  spawning any sub-agent on it, confirm the user wants sub-agents to
  potentially use it (it is only a candidate when actually available in
  the session). Two modes the user picks: (a) case-by-case, where the
  spawner still applies the judgment call — the heavy hitter only for
  the hardest tasks that genuinely out-reach the mid tier, not the
  default; or (b) always route the heavy tier to it. Absent an explicit
  yes, the heavy tier stays the mid tier.

## Advisory escalation — the heavy hitter thinks, cheaper tiers implement

A sub-agent unsure of an implementation detail — a typing approach, a
behavioral edge, an ambiguous convention — consults instead of guessing:
spawn a short read-only heavy-hitter advisor with a crisp question plus
the minimal context, take the recommendation, and implement it on its
own cheaper tier. The advisor only advises — it never edits files or
runs mutating commands; implementation always stays with the asking
agent's tier. Advisory spawns are a standing exception to the opt-in
above, granted when the user installs this rule; putting
*implementation* on the heavy hitter still needs the explicit yes.
Spawner briefs for delegated work name this escape hatch, so delegated
agents know consulting — not guessing — is the fallback.

## The spawner is the reviewer

When a cheaper-model agent returns, review its diff before committing —
use `/code-review` for non-trivial batches (see
`.claude/rules/code-review.md`). Cheaper execution behind a review gate
beats running everything on the top tier.

Set the model explicitly on each spawn (`model:` on the Agent tool, or
`model`/`effort` per stage in a Workflow) rather than relying on
inheritance.

## Parallel execution safety

- **Usage limits are per-model.** A wide fan-out can exhaust a tier
  mid-run and strand half-applied work — size the fan-out to the tier,
  and commit in verified batches so a limit or restart never loses
  progress.
- **Parallel file-mutating agents share one working tree.** Disjoint
  file scopes don't protect them: git acts on the whole tree, so one
  stray `stash` or `reset` clobbers concurrent edits. Give them
  `isolation: "worktree"`, or forbid git in the brief (edit only
  assigned files, run only read-only checks), then gate the batch on a
  full typecheck + test suite. Read-only agents parallelize safely.
