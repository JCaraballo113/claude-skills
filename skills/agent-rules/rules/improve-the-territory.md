# improve-the-territory.md

Applies: every project.

Existing code is precedent, not gospel — each copy of a flawed pattern
entrenches its debt one file deeper. When a change touches a pattern,
leave the territory better than found. Generate the rule naming the
project's real shared layers:

- **Search for shared infrastructure before copying.** Check the
  project's helper and library layers (`tests/helpers/`, `lib/`, or this
  project's equivalents) and sibling modules first — the neighbor being
  mirrored may itself be the outlier.
- **Fix debt in the files already being changed** — duplicated
  scaffolding, copy-pasted boilerplate, smells flagged in tracked
  issues.
- **File a follow-up issue for offenders outside the diff.** Improvement
  rides the territory being touched; repo-wide sweeps get their own
  issue so the diff stays honest.
- **Escalate uncertainty instead of guessing.** Unsure how (or whether)
  to improve a piece of debt: ask the spawner — the advisory tier from
  `.claude/rules/subagent-model-tiering.md`. When agent and advisor are
  both unsure, stop and run `/grill-with-docs` with the human to reach
  the decision together — only when that skill passes the
  installed-check (wording in SKILL.md); when it doesn't, hold the
  decision conversation with the user directly.
- **Sub-agent briefs carry this rule:** "match conventions; where
  precedent carries debt, improve it and report it." Reports list
  improvements made and debt seen but left, so the spawner's diff review
  weighs both.
